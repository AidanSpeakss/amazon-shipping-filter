## **What's the purpose of this extension?**  
Filters amazon listings based on whether they are climate pledge friendly or not. Non climate friendly products will be greyed out for you. 
Might stress your CPU a little on low-end devices, but well worth the load times to save the environment!  

## **What is the "Climate Pledge Friendly" label?**  
Climate Pledge Friendly products are more sustainable, and buying these products exclusively will give companies a financial incentive to be more sustainable.
